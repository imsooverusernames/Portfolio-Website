# 🌐 Portfolio Website

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm a **Frontend Developer** passionate about building visually appealing and interactive web experiences. This site acts as my digital business card—showcasing my work, skills, and projects while allowing visitors to get in touch with me effortlessly.

## 💡 Problem It Solves

In today’s digital-first world, having a strong online presence is essential. However, many developers struggle with:

- Presenting their work in a visually engaging way
- Demonstrating their coding ability beyond GitHub repositories
- Offering a simple and fast method of contact

This portfolio solves these challenges by combining clean design, fluid animations, and responsive layouts to provide an intuitive, engaging experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **React** for component-based architecture and reusability
- **Toast Notifications** for subtle user feedback
- **Custom Hosting Solution** (domain and deployment)

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🎨 **Light/Dark Mode** toggle for accessibility and user preference
- ✨ **Smooth Scrolling and Animations** to enhance user experience
- 🔔 **Toast Notifications** for real-time feedback and alerts
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ⚡ **Optimized Performance** with minimal dependencies

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

### 1. **Animating SVGs**
Creating dynamic, interactive SVG animations while maintaining performance and browser compatibility was challenging. After experimentation, I found ways to integrate SVG paths with CSS and JS to bring designs to life.
### 2. **Refactoring to React**
The original version of this site was written using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Transitioning the project to React involved breaking down each section into reusable components and managing state for dynamic features like dark mode and toast notifications.
